        <h2>A Week in the Wild</h2>
        <p>I was lucky to find the time to spend three days with a longtime friend in Mammoth Lakes! We explored just a few of the wonders that nature has to offer!</p>
          <h4><div id="day1">Day 1</div></h4>
            <p>On our first day, we stopped for lunch in the village to decide on where we would spend the night. Then, we stopped at Vons to pick up groceries. We had our sights set on camping at Twin Lakes, but drove up to find <strong>CLOSED</strong> taped across the sign. Before trekking out to any other campgrounds, we decided to check in at the ranger station to see where we might have the best luck finding a campsite for the night. After being assured that Long Lakes was in fact open, we ventured out to <em>Inyo National Forest</em> and found a spot at the East Fork Campgrounds.
              <br /><br />Once our tents were up, we cracked open some refreshing beverages. While enjoying said drinks, we both noticed a squirrel scurry up a tree with something in its mouth: an entire cookie! A minute later, we were even more surprised to see another squirrel with a similar cookie. After another minute, we saw another squirrel scamper up the tree with not one, but three stacked cookies! We didn't want to have crumbs scattered across our campsite to attract larger animals in the night, so we had to investigate. We wandered in the direction that the squirrels had all come from and found cartons of covered food stacked on top of the designated bear boxes. Of course, one of the covers was off and we saw a nearly empty box of cookies. We stood watch to prevent any other squirrel feasting and notified the campsite manager.

              <br /><br />After the mystery was solved, we made dinner and ended the night with an epic game of Scrabble.</p>
          <h4><div id="day2">Day 2</div></h4>
            <p>On the second day, we rolled out of bed and made breakfast. Then, we set out for a 3 mile hike to Long Lake. There were beautiful wildflowers and rushing streams coming from the melting glaciers. Because there are so many lakes in the area and no signs once you're on the trail, we had to keep guessing if we had reached our destination. We eventually got to a flooded area of the trail and couldn't find a clear or easy path to continue. Determined to complete our hike, we traced the edge of the flooding to find a slightly traveled path, eventually scrambling across large boulders to a point where a trail was no longer distinguishable. We stopped for a minute to enjoy the view and take a sip of water, but then slowly made out way back.
            <br /><br /><img src="https://scontent-dft4-2.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/20264998_10155264366150622_4141123977206510881_n.jpg?oh=d345e895a45cd92341cb20b98310d5aa&oe=5A008FEC" height="500" /></p>
          <h4><div id="day3">Day 3</div></h4>
            <p>On the third day, we had to go back in town for a quick doctor's appointment. We packed up our tents and headed back into town, but not before a short hike around Convict Lake. Running short on time before the appointment, we immediately started on the trail. About 10 minutes in, I stopped in awe: there was a bright orange spot in the plants. I immediately stopped to get a closer look and found it to be a moth, which I later identified as a Elegant Sheep Moth (<em>Hemileuca eglanterina</em>). After this wonderful sighting, I kept my eyes our for other miraculous creatures.
              <br /><br /><img src="https://scontent-dft4-2.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/20294010_10155264365945622_245925416735939425_n.jpg?oh=1e1817aac427bc98e0920571f8e5389f&oe=5A043439" height="500" />
              <br /><br />We were only able to go half way around the lake due to flooding on the trail, but I was happy to find a cluster of butterflies gracing the path. It was almost magical to see them fly around as we walked past. We made our way back with enough time for a quick lunch of hummus and guacamole with chips and sweet cherries.
              <br/><br /> We made our way back into town and while I was waiting for my friend to finish her appointment, I discovered <a href="http://www.mammothfunshop.com/" target="_blank">The Mammoth Lakes Fun Shop</a>. It was such a whimsical shop filled with all kinds of toys, games, gifts, and ice cream. I didn't intend to get any ice cream, but they insisted I at least try it and I was won over. Peppermint pattie on a cone is such a delight, especially on a warm summer day! I also made it to the <a href="http://secondchancemammoth.org/" target="_blank">Second Chance Thrift Shop</a>, where the benefits support Disable Sports Eastern Sierra. I browsed their store to find some great items, particularly outdoor gear and small furniture, but I didn't find any treasures calling to me in particular.
            <br /><br />Once my friend was ready to go, we headed back up to Twin Lakes for our second attempt. When we got to the sign, we were pleasantly surprised that the <strong>CLOSED</strong> sticker was nowhere to be found. With newfound hope, we drove around the lower campground, noticing that many campsites were closed for repair, and completed the loop with no luck. We stopped by the shop and the man inside was not eager to help, likely because he's able to sell cabins to anyone who is unable to find a campsite. Once we drove around the upper campgrounds, it seemed that we would have to go somewhere else, until we both spotted an open campsite and immediately swooped in. We set up our tents, then went out for a short hike to take a tip in one of the Twin Lakes.

          <h4><div id="day4">Day 4</div></h4>
            <p>This morning, we woke up early to pack up camp and head back into town. I stopped by Schat Bakery to get their famous jalapeno cheddar bread, but we got there too early and I was happy to get a large cream cheese and fruit croissant, a few nutty pastries, and a "black bear claw", which was a dark chocolate treat filled with caramel and complete with almond "claws". I also stopped by Black Velvet Coffee to get some beans for my brother. I dropped off my friend and we said our goodbyes before I drove back home in just 5 hours.
